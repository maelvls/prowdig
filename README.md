# Prow dig

Dig into Prow logs of cert-manager to find which test cases have a timeout too
high compared to the "passed" runs of that test. You must have read access to the
bucket `gs://jetstack-logs` in order to run prowdig. To log in to the bucket, run:

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```

I wrote this tool because some Prow jobs in cert-manager would fail after almost
2 hours due to overly large timeouts in tests.

Install:

```sh
go install github.com/maelvls/prowdig@latest
```

Run:

```sh
$ prowdig max-duration --limit=20

prowdig displays the test cases for the jobs from the 20 last PRs. The format
is:

```plain
24s     5m9s    [cert-manager] Vault ClusterIssuer CertificateRequest...
^        ^      ^
|        |      The test name.
|        |
|        Max. duration of "passed".
|
Max. duration of "failed".
```

prowdig displays test cases by ascending order of priority ("priority" meaning
that you should take a look at this test case). The last test case displayed is
the one with the highest difference between the max. duration of "passed" and
max. duration of "failed". The test cases for which no "failed" result are not
displayed.

Since the build-log.txt files large (can go up to 36MB in case of many timeouts,
which is around 600MB for 20 PRs which account for 476 `build-log.txt` files),
prowdig caches the files in `~/.cache/prowdig`. This folder may get big, feel
free to delete it when you are done:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.cache/prowdig
```

prowdig works by fetching the `junit__xx.xml` files from the jobs of the last 20
PRs. But there is a caveat to it: the junit files are only uploaded when the
Prow job finishes before the job's timeout (which about 2 hours). Which means
that in order to find out which tests have timed out, we have to look at the raw
build-log.txt and parse errors of the form:

```plain
â€¢ Failure [301.437 seconds]
[Conformance] Certificates
test/e2e/framework/framework.go:287
  with issuer type External ClusterIssuer
  test/e2e/suite/conformance/certificates.go:47
    should issue a cert with wildcard DNS Name [It]
    test/e2e/suite/conformance/certificates.go:105
    Unexpected error:

        <*errors.errorString | 0xc0001c07b0>: {
            s: "timed out waiting for the condition",
        }
        timed out waiting for the condition
    occurred
    test/e2e/suite/conformance/certificates.go:522
------------------------------
```

If you would like to list the Ginkgo failures that happened
in a given file (can be a URL), you can run:

```
prowdig parse-logs https://storage.googleapis.com/jetstack-logs/pr-logs/pull/jetstack_cert-manager/4044/pull-cert-manager-e2e-v1-21/1395667201859522561/build-log.txt
```

That will show you an overview of the failures:

```
